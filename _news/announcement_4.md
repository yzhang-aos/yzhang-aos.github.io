A new paper led by <a href="https://heng-quan.github.io/">Heng Quan</a>, third-year graduate student of Princeton University, is published in Journal of Atmospheric Sciences. In this <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/aop/JAS-D-24-0140.1/JAS-D-24-0140.1.xml">paper</a>, Heng made a convincing case for weaker horizontal temperature gradients in a warmer climate, extending our fundamental understanding for tropical atmospheric dynamics that is based on the weak-temperature-gradient approximation.
