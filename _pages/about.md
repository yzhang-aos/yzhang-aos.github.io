I am a postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley, working with Professor <a href='https://boos.berkeley.edu'>William Boos</a>. I earned my PhD from Princeton University advised by Professor <a href='https://fueglistaler.princeton.edu'>Stephan Fueglistaler</a>. I study atmospheric dynamics and climate change. My dissertation synthesized long-standing theoretical ideas to develop quantitative constraints on several aspects of tropical climate. These aspects include the onset of tropical atmospheric convection, the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation, and the sensitivity of clear-sky outgoing longwave radiation to surface warming, which is a significant component of climate sensitivity. I am interested in advancing fundamental understanding of atmospheric dynamics and the interaction between dynamics, thermodynamics, and radiative transfer, emphasizing how these physical processes constrain extreme climate variables. In general, I follow a research path that encompasses understanding the underlying physics, developing analytical theories, and testing these theories against observational datasets and numerical simulations.
