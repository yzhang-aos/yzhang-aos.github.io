I am a Miller Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, hosted by Professor <a href='https://boos.berkeley.edu'>William Boos</a>. I earned my PhD from Princeton University advised by Professor <a href='https://fueglistaler.princeton.edu'>Stephan Fueglistaler</a>. 

Full of uncertainty and disorder, the Earthâ€™s climate system is a unique subject in complex systems science. Reducing complex phenomena to simple laws is fascinating to me as a scientist. 

Climate science also serves a more practical mission -- to better prepare societies worldwide for the impact of climate change. Accurately predicting future changes in climate and extreme weather requires a fundamental understanding of underlying physical mechanisms.

I am interested in advancing fundamental understanding of atmospheric dynamics and the interaction between dynamics, thermodynamics, and radiative transfer. I follow a research path that integrates understanding the underlying physics, developing analytical theories, and testing these theories against observational datasets and numerical simulations.
